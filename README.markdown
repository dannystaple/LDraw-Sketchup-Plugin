A Sketch up plugin to import LDraw files
========================================

Synopsis
--------
LDraw is a popular CAD format used for the 3D modelling of Lego creations. LDraw has a part library with a large selection of the Lego parts (not all), and a text based file format.

This importer uses the LDraw parts and primitives library with your model (created in perhaps MLCad/LeoCAD or Bricksmith) to recreate the geometry in Sketchup.
